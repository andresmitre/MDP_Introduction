## About

This repository gives a brief introduction to understand Markov Decision Process (MDP). The following material is part of Artificial Intellegence (AI) class by Phd. Carlos A. Lara √Ålvarez in [Center for Research In Mathematics-CIMAT](https://www.cimat.mx/) (Spring 2019).

Two exercises are given.
    * Wikipedia exercise - Example of a simple MDP with three states (green circles) and two actions (orange circles), with two rewards (orange arrows)..
    * World-grid - Example of a MDP with 13 stages (white boxes) and four actions (up, right, down, left), with two rewards (green box and red box)
