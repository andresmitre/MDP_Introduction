# Markov Decision Process for dummies.

## About

This repository gives a brief introduction to understand Markov Decision Process (MDP). The following material is part of Artificial Intellegence (AI) class by Phd. Carlos A. Lara √Ålvarez in [Center for Research In Mathematics-CIMAT](https://www.cimat.mx/) (Spring 2019).

Two exercises are given.
* Wikipedia exercise - Example of a simple MDP with three states (green circles) and two actions (orange circles), with two rewards (orange arrows)..
* World-grid - Example of a MDP with 13 stages (white boxes) and four actions (up, right, down, left), with two rewards (green box and red box)


The algorithm consist on a **Policy Iteration**. For an explanation of policy Iteration I highly recommend to read ["Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard Sutton](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html).

Policy Iteration uses a **policy evaluation** (evaluate a given policy) and **policy improvement** (finds the best policy).

## Software

The scripts was tested with MATLAB.
